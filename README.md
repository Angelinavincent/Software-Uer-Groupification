# Software-User-Groupification: Applied Project 2024

This repository contains the final code, dashboard, and related files for the "Software-User-Groupification" project, which aims to enhance onboarding efficiency by analyzing software provisioning patterns and identifying tailored application groups.

## Project Overview
The project addresses inefficiencies in software provisioning during onboarding, leveraging data analytics and clustering techniques to streamline processes and ensure new hires are productive from day one.

### Key Features:
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Processed 15M+ rows of raw data to extract 1.02M actionable rows for analysis.
- **Clustering with MiniBatch K-Means**: Identified distinct application usage groups, surpassing traditional methods and reducing redundancies.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Built using Tableau to provide actionable insights and visualizations.

## Repository Contents
- **Final Code - Applied Project 2024.ipynb**: The complete Python code for data preparation, clustering, and analysis.
- **Final Dashboard - Applied Project.twb**: Tableau dashboard showcasing insights and visualizations.
- **README.md**: Repository documentation.
